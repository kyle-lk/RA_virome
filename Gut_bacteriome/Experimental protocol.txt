16S rDNA amplicon sequencing
The bacterial genomic DNA was extracted using the Fast DNA SPIN extraction kits (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA), quantitated and qualified by NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and agarose gel electrophoresis, respectively. PCR amplification of the bacterial 16S rDNA genes V3–V4 region was performed using the forward primer 338F (5’-ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCA-3’) and the reverse primer 806R (5’-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3’). PCR amplicons were purified with Agencourt AMPure beads (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN) and quantified using the PicoGreen dsDNA Assay Kit (Invitrogen). The pair-end 2 × 300 bp sequencing was performed using the Illumina MiSeq platform with MiSeq Reagent Kit v3.

Bioinformatic analysis

16S rDNA sequencing data analyses were mainly performed using the QIIME2 (Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology, version 1.8.0) pipeline and R packages (v3.6.3), as previously described. Annotation of bacteria OTUs was based on SILVA 138.1.
